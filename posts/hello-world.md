## Blog? Does this work in 2022?

The answer to this question is a big **it depends**.

We are in the age of social networks. So trying to impose a different format is pretty much starting dead. So, thinking about uniting the two worlds, my focus will be on using this space to complement the content I intend to share on social networks.
